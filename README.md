# Windows 11 - Made by Gemini 3 Flash

A premium, state-of-the-art Windows 11 simulation built entirely by AI (Gemini 3 Flash). This project features a functional in-browser SQLite database, a hardware-aware PC Builder, a fully simulated BIOS, and a complete OOBE (Out-of-Box Experience) setup flow.

## 🚀 Features
- **PC Builder**: Choose your CPU, RAM, and Storage before "installing" the OS.
- **BIOS/UEFI**: Simulated Aptio Setup Utility to verify hardware.
- **SQLite Database**: A real SQL engine running in your browser (`sql.js`), persisting data to `localStorage`.
- **Microsoft Store**: Browse and "install" apps.
- **Edge Browser**: Explore the web directly within the simulation.
- **OOBE Flow**: Complete Windows 11 setup experience, including network bypass tricks.
- **System Apps**: Notepad, Calculator, SQL Terminal, Registry Editor, and more.
